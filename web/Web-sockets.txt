Key Points :::> 
1. The CONNECTION and UPGRADE headers in the request and response indicate that this is a WebSocket handshake. 
 2. The SEC-WEBSOCKET-VERSION request header specifies the WebSocket protocol version that the client wishes to use. 
  3. The SEC-WEBSOCKET-KEY request header contains a Base64-encoded random value, which should be randomly generated in each handshake request.
    4. The SEC-WEBSOCKET-ACCEPT response header contains a hash of the value submitted in the SEC-WEBSOCKET-KEY request header, concatenated with a specific string defined in the protocol specification. This is done to prevent misleading responses resulting from misconfigured servers or caching proxies.
