SQL injection 

rational and non rational databases

rational - structured data is stored like excel sheets , sheets an be connected to each other.

non-rational - data can be stored in flexible format such as key-value pairs, graphs, documents, wide column stores.

NOTE:----

Try typing an apostrophe ( ' ) after the id=1 and press enter. And you'll see this returns an SQL error informing you of an error in your syntax. The fact that you've received this error message confirms the existence of an SQL Injection vulnerability. We can now exploit this vulnerability and use the error messages to learn more about the database structure.
