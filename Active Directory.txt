common attack --> 

                             [&] Golden ticket attacks
						|
						|_ _ attacker exploit Kerberos protocol and impersonate any account on the AD by forging Ticket Granting Ticket(TGT).  they uses password hash.

attacker requires this much of information to do this attack
1.  FQDN - Fully Qualified Domain Name
2.  SID of the domain
3.  Username of an account to impersonate
4.  KRBTGT account password hash

detection of this type of attack 
* Event ID 4768: looks for TGT request for high-privilege accounts
* Event ID 4672: this logs when special privileges( like SeTcbPrivilege) are assigned to a user

				[&] Pass-the-hash 
					|
					|_ _ stealing hash of the pass and used to authenticate to services without needing actual password.
the NTLM protocol allows authentication based on password hashes.

mitigation of this type of attacks
1. enforcing strong password policies 
2. regularly audits on privileges and multi-factor authentication

				 [&] Kerberoasting
						|
						|_ _ attacker request service tickets for account with service principal names (SPNs), extracts the tickets and password hashes, and then attempts to crack them offline to retrieve the plain text passwords.
